I don't belive in god. But here i am, on a rock(Earth), revolving another extremely hot rock(Sun) about 30km per second in the empty space. Every single thing that happend so far is a riddiculous accident or you can call it a co-incidence including our birth and evolution. So i'm thankfull for this immense entropy and the Sun.

Stay tunned because i'm going to write a lot more boring stuff like this.
